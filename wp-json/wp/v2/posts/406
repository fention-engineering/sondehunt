Unfortunately I was only able to break loose on 09.11. and started a cold sonde search to get a hold of the DFMs, which are quite rare in our region. Three sondes were on the agenda: First I went to the 1600Z sonde, which was supposed to lie on a field at Spich, then to the 2030Z sonde to a riding school near Leverkusen and finally to the 1030Z sonde in a residential area near Honrath.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"sonde-find-block_5c65890b390e3\" class=\"sonde-find \">\n    <iframe src=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=50.82426, 7.08592&#038;hl=en&amp;z=10&amp;t=h&amp;output=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"display:block; border:0; width: 100%; height: 250px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><\/iframe>\n    <div style =\"background-color:#fff; margin-bottom:20px; padding: 20px\">\n        <div style = \"font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'; font-size: 1.5em;\">NO2 Baumholder \u2013 Spich<\/div>\n        <div style = \"margin-top:5px;font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; font-size: 1.1em;\">Graw DFM-09 \/ 17008986 \/ 06.11.2018 1600Z<\/div>\n        <div style=\"font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono';margin-top:15px\">\n            <span><a style=\"color:#666;\" href=\"https:\/\/sondehub.org\/616066\" target=\"_blank\">\ud83d\udd17 sondehub.org<\/a><\/span>\n            <span style=\"background-color:#da0031;padding:1px 4px;float:right;color:#fff;\">too late :&#8217;s<\/span>\n        <\/div>\n        <div style=\"font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono';margin-top:10px\">\n            <span ><a style=\"color:#666;\" href=\"https:\/\/radiosondy.info\/sonde.php?sondenumber=DF63895A\" target=\"_blank\">\ud83d\udd17 radiosondy.info<\/a><\/span>\n            <span style=\"background-color:#00632E;padding:1px 4px;float:right;color:#fff;\">public transport<\/span>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>In Spich the sonde should have landed on a field or an adjacent caravan site. After the field had been searched unsuccessfully, the landlord also let me search on the caravan site, but without success.

I was incredibly relieved that the position had been right this time and went directly to the office of the riding school to introduce my aims. After I had received green light, the recovery began. The sonde had landed on a paddock and had already been put down behind the fence. The parachute hung in approx. 2.5 m height in a fruit tree, could be freed well however, so that I could salvage the entire set. An accompanying letter was not present, instead a glowstick was indeed. I hurried with the way back and just reached the suburban train back to Cologne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"sonde-find-block_5c658bdd564de\" class=\"sonde-find \">\n    <iframe src=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=50.904812, 7.237896&#038;hl=en&amp;z=10&amp;t=h&amp;output=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"display:block; border:0; width: 100%; height: 250px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><\/iframe>\n    <div style =\"background-color:#fff; margin-bottom:20px; padding: 20px\">\n        <div style = \"font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'; font-size: 1.5em;\">#6 Baumholder \u2013 Honrath<\/div>\n        <div style = \"margin-top:5px;font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; font-size: 1.1em;\">Graw DFM-09 \/ 17008357 \/ 06.11.2018 1030Z<\/div>\n        <div style=\"font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono';margin-top:15px\">\n            <span><a style=\"color:#666;\" href=\"https:\/\/sondehub.org\/17009173\" target=\"_blank\">\ud83d\udd17 sondehub.org<\/a><\/span>\n            <span style=\"background-color:#da0031;padding:1px 4px;float:right;color:#fff;\">tinker sonde<\/span>\n        <\/div>\n        <div style=\"font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono';margin-top:10px\">\n            <span ><a style=\"color:#666;\" href=\"https:\/\/radiosondy.info\/sonde.php?sondenumber=DF6386E5\" target=\"_blank\">\ud83d\udd17 radiosondy.info<\/a><\/span>\n            <span style=\"background-color:#00632E;padding:1px 4px;float:right;color:#fff;\">public transport<\/span>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>The last search on the way home in Honrath was exactly clocked, if I did not want to walk the four kilometers back to the station, I would have to catch the last bus about twenty minutes after my arrival. Three houses came into question. At the middle one nobody opened. A girl opened the door for me in the western neighbour&#8217;s house, but she knew nothing at all. Finally I had success at the eastern neighbour and was able to take my second DFM. However, the parachute had landed in the neighbour&#8217;s garden who had not been home. I reached the bus and made my way home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the days around 06.11.2018 numerous manoeuvre sondes started from the military training area Baumholder and as a result of the extraordinary wind some of them landed in the Cologne and Siegen area.
