On the first day of the math precourse at my university, in which I participated every year as a tutor, it finally happened, and P2740506 landed in Breckerfeld, a little further than 40 km away. ON-1 lost the signal at over one kilometre altitude, it would either be a forest landing, or the probe would have made it to a meadow in the valley.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the tutorial a short arrangement with flynamic, who picked me up at the TH around 17:00 o&#8217;clock. We drove briefly by my home to pick up the big Yagi, because the Moxon was still relatively new and I wanted to be on the safe side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After our arrival at the hiking car park the disappointment followed while decoding: The probe had landed a few hundred meters before the meadow in the forest. We went to the landing point. The closer we came, the greater my excitement was. We hit into the forest and had luck: in the high spruce trees the probe dangled in approx. 2 m height and waited to be picked by us. Parachute and balloon remainings were inaccessibly high, and thus we went, highly pleased, with a probe in the luggage under a dreamlike sunset back home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bn1fIDTH_pI\/\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a few weeks I had been waiting for an Essen sonde to land near Gummersbach. flynamic, which I had infected with my probe fever, was on board within a radius of 40 km.
